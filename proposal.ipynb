    "Since the 1990s, developed countries have begun to cultivate a large number of data analysts. Until now, the demand for data analysts has continued to grow, and there is still an expansion. More and more people are choosing to enter the data analysis industry, and novices are eager to know more about the characteristics of the industry."
